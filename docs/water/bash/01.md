```
__substitution__

```sh
text1=" world"
echo "Hello : "$username
echo "Hello : ${txt1}"
```


__Streams__

```sh
# output of ls will be written to list.txt
ls -l > list.txt

# append output to list.txt
ls -a >> list.txt

# all errors will be written to errors.txt
grep da * 2> errors.txt

# read from errors.txt
less < errors.txt
```

__Pipes__

```sh
ls -l | grep .md$ | less
```

__cmd execution__

```sh
# command2 will be executed after command1
command1 ; command2
# command2 will be executed if, and only if, command1 finishes successfully (returns 0 exit status)
command1 && command2
# command2 will be executed if, and only if, command1 finishes unsuccessfully (returns code of error)
command1 || command2
```

## Arrays

__Declaration__

```sh
# eg 1
fruits[0]=Apple
fruits[1]=Pear
fruits[2]=Plum
# eg 2
fruits=(Apple Pear Plum)
```

__Expansion__

```sh
echo ${fruits[1]} # Pear
echo ${fruits[*]} # Apple Pear Plum
echo ${fruits[@]} # Apple Pear Plum

printf "+ %s\n" "${fruits[@]}"
# + Apple
# + Desert fig

# eg : Delete
unset fruits[0]
echo ${fruits[@]} # Apple Desert fig Plum Banana Cherry
```

### Opertaor

```sh
add=$((1+1))
sub=$((5-1))
