# Introduction

Imagine, if you will, the early 1990s. A young Finnish computer science student, Linus Torvalds, sat down at his computer, frustrated with the limitations of the operating systems he had access to. He didn’t just complain about it—he decided to build something new, something of his own. What started as a small project, just a kernel—the core part of an operating system—soon evolved into something much bigger. This kernel, which he named Linux, was released in 1991, and that’s where the real story began.

You see, Linus didn’t keep his creation to himself. He made it open for others to use, modify, and improve. Before long, developers from all over the world began to contribute to it. They combined his kernel with a collection of software tools, creating complete operating systems known as Linux distributions. And just like that, what began as one person’s solution to a problem became a global movement.

Now, why has Linux stood the test of time? Well, think about its stability—people trust it to run the world’s most powerful servers. Consider its security—widely respected, especially in a world where data breaches are a constant threat. And let’s not forget its flexibility—Linux can run on anything from supercomputers to the smallest embedded devices. Developers love how customizable it is, and that’s a big part of its appeal. It’s not just software anymore; it’s a community-driven model of innovation.

So, what about you? When you think about Linux, what strikes you as its most impressive quality—its rock-solid stability, its robust security, or perhaps the way it lets you shape it to fit your needs?

## Linux is just a kernel

> Linux is not an operating system; it’s just a kernel.

- That is absolutely correct. However, let’s take a different approach. Think of operating systems as vehicles: any kind of vehicle, be it a motorbike, a car or a truck.
- What is at the core of a vehicle? An engine.
- Think of the kernel as the engine. It’s an essential part of the vehicle and you cannot use the vehicle without it.

But you cannot drive an engine, can you? You need many other things to interact with the engine and drive the vehicle. You need wheels, steering, gears, a clutch, brakes and more to drive a vehicle on top of that engine.

Similarly, you cannot use a kernel on its own. You need lots of tools to interact with the kernel and use the operating system. These things could be a shell, commands, the graphical interface (also called desktop environment), etc.

This makes sense, right? Now that you understand this analogy, let’s take it further so that you understand the rest of it.

> The kernel is not something exclusive to Linux. You may not have realized, but Windows, macOS and other operating systems have a kernel underneath as well. Microsoft Windows operating systems are based on the Windows NT kernel. Apple’s macOS is based on the XNU kernel.

- kernel = engine
- Linux kernel = specific type of engine
- desktop operating systems = cars
- server operating systems = heavy trucks
- embedded systems = motorbikes
- desktop environments = body of the vehicle along with interiors (dashboard etc.)
- themes and icons = paint job, rim job and other customizable features
- applications = accessories you use for a specific purpose (like the music system)
