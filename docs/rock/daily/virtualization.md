#### 1. Virtualization

Virtualization is a powerful feature in Linux that allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single machine without needing additional hardware. With tools like **VirtualBox**, **KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)**, and **VMware**, you can create virtual machines (VMs) for testing software, trying out different Linux distributions, or running applications that are only available on other operating systems. This flexibility not only saves resources but also enhances security by isolating environments.
