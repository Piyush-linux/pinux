## Linux File tree

> Everything in linux is a file, even an directory / folder is a type of file which contain other files

![](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/linux-directory-tree.jpg)

- `/` : Root Directory, this act like base dir to store other files
- `/home` : Home Directory, this is where the user's desktop, documents & music dir are stored
- `/etc , /var ...` : Other Directories, also have their own purpose which we will learn in upcoming modules 



## Directory

```sh
mkdir 
rmdir
ls
touch
rm 
```


- Create directory
```sh [Create dir]
# Create & list dir1, dir2
user> mkdir dir1 dir2 
user> ls 
user> dir1 dir2
```

- Remove dir
```sh
user> rmdir dir1
user> ls 
user> dir2
```

- Change directory
	- relative vs absolute path
```sh [Change dir]
# change path to dir2 (relative path)
user> cd ./dir2
user/dir2> 

# change path to home
user/dir2> cd ~ 
user>

# change path to dir2 (absolute path)
user> cd /user/dir2
user/dir2> 

# change path to root
user> cd /
/>
```

- Display my current path
```sh [where am i]
user/dir2> pwd
/home/user/dir2 # my current path
```

### Working with File

- Create file

```sh
touch file1.txt 
touch file1.txt file3.txt file2.txt
```

- Display file
```sh
cat file1.txt 
```

- List file

```sh
# list files
user> ls
user> dir1 dir2 file.txt 

# list meta data
user> ls -lh

# list hidden files
user> ls -a
```

- Remove file

```
rm file.txt
```

- Copy File

```sh
cp file1.txt file2.txt
# copy file1 to Desktop (absolute path)
cp file1.txt ~/user/Desktop/
```

- Rename File

```sh
mv file0.txt file1.txt
```

- Move File
```sh
# move file1 complete;y to Desktop
mv file1.txt ~/user/Desktop
```

- Detect File Type

```sh
file file1.txt
```
